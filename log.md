# Project Log - Shadows of the 1920s

Track all major milestones, feature additions, and bug fixes here.

## [Initial Phase]
*   **Core Setup:** Initialized project structure with React, Tailwind, and Lucide-icons.
*   **Engine:** Created a hexagonal grid board with pixel-to-hex conversion logic.
*   **Investigators:** Defined initial character roster: Detective, Professor, Journalist, Veteran, Occultist, and Doctor.

## [v1.1 - v3.9.3]
*   *(Previous logs collapsed for brevity - see history)*
*   **v3.9.2:** Eldritch Visions (Lore-accurate AI Art).
*   **v3.9.3:** The Roguelite Expansion (Traits & Modifiers).

## [v3.9.4 Update - Hex Clarity & Navigation]
*   **Visual Overhaul:** Replaced CSS borders with SVG overlays for tiles. This fixes the issue where hex borders were cut off at corners.
*   **Dead End Indicators:** Implemented dynamic wall rendering. The grid now visually indicates blocked directions/dead ends on the hex edges where no connection exists.
*   **Ghost Tiles:** Improved visibility of valid move targets with dashed outlines.
