# Project Log - Shadows of the 1920s

Track all major milestones, feature additions, and bug fixes here.

## [Initial Phase]
*   **Core Setup:** Initialized project structure with React, Tailwind, and Lucide-icons.
*   **Engine:** Created a hexagonal grid board with pixel-to-hex conversion logic.
*   **Investigators:** Defined initial character roster: Detective, Professor, Journalist, Veteran, Occultist, and Doctor.

## [v1.1 - v3.9.2]
*   *(Previous logs collapsed for brevity - see history)*
*   **v3.9:** Sequential Mythos AI & Swarm Logic.
*   **v3.9.1:** Monster Spawn Fixes & Icons.
*   **v3.9.2:** Eldritch Visions (Lore-accurate AI Art).

## [v3.9.3 Update - The Roguelite Expansion]
*   **Meta-Progression:** Implemented **Veteran Traits**. Survivors now gain random traits (Positive or Negative) upon completing a scenario, making them unique persistent characters.
*   **Run Variance:** Added **Scenario Modifiers**. Each new game rolls a random global effect (e.g., "Thick Fog", "Blood Moon", "Dwindling Supply") that alters gameplay rules for that run.
*   **UI Updates:** Character Panel now displays acquired traits. Main HUD shows active scenario modifiers.
